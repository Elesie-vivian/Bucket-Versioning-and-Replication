This Project demonstrates S3 bucket versioning and replication on AWS mangement console.

The aim is to show how S3 bucket versioning can  facilitate management of files, and recall previous versions.

This can protect from unintended overwrites and deletions,ensuring multiple versions of a file object can be in one bucket.

We configure cross-region replication (CRR) to duplicate or reproduce files contained in a bucket into a bucket in another region.

At the end of this project, we test the versioning and replication functionalities; note that replication is only possible if versioning has been enabled in the bucket.
